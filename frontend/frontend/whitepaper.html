        <h2>Market Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Markets move in cycles, there is a recession then a recovery period, this movement can be plotted along a productivity curve. Everyone loves a free market when it appreciates hand over fist, but no one likes a free market when it depreciates fist over hand. Cryptocurrency is no exception to this, and the currency is one of the most volatile asset classes of the century.</p>

        <h2>Motivating factors behind cryptocurrency</h2>

        <p>The promise of decentralization, fast and efficient transfer, and distributed system architecture has created a lot of retail and institutional interest around this technology. Speculation on price appreciation has been the driving factor in getting users to join the crypto community. The nature of Cryptocurrency and its disruption target naturally lead to incredible price appreciation. However, there are disadvantages to using a currency such as bitcoin, that naturally encours price appreciation.</p>

        <p>Rapid and sudden price appreciation therefore incentivises users to hodl their cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Rational actors who wish to maximize benefit will put their money into dapps which can then be accessed by enterprising individuals and entrepreneurs. This has the potential to decrease the disproportional increase in wealth flowing to a minority of visible actors. Instead of buying stock in prevalent companies and/or you can make loans cheaper and increase innovation.</p>

        <p>Innovation is not a product of big business and government, these are dead corpses of what was once an innovative lively being. It is essential not that resources be taken away from individuals that have earned them, but be accessible to those with the spirit to innovate.</p>

        <h2>Calcoin</h2>

        <p>So why would we need a currency that keeps its value, and if we did that how would we leverage the incentive to early adopters without seeing price appreciation? The issue arises that individuals would want liquidity at a similar price and sidestep the unreasonable nature of the dollar for a currency that decreases in value every year, but the truth is that bitcoin and other currencies see falls in price as well, this created demand for a stable currency that is not tied to an arbitrary market such as the dollar.</p>

        <p>Calcoin aims to independently create a currency that maintains constant price, by paying early holders the new currency that has been created. Users have the opportunity to give Calcoin to a factory whereby factory holders receive cal that was created to make the money supply constant, however when liquidity leaves the system, cal is removed from these factories and providers lose a proportional stake. In addition stakers also receive rewards for staking their currency.</p>
